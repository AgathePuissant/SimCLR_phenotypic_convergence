# Convergence in sympatric swallowtail butterflies reveal the significance of ecological interactions as driver of trait diversification at global scale


This repository contains the python code necessary to: 
- Segment butterfly images into 4 wings and remove all other parts
- Cluster the images into phenotypic groups
- Train a SimCLR model on these images
- Optimize the hyperparameters of the model based on classification evaluation
- Generate embeddings from a trained model

And the R code necessary to:
- Visualize the morpho space
- Run a permutation test to assess convergence and divergence in sympatry
- Assess which sex contributes to recent dimorphism evolution
